0,1508.01331,polytropic transonic galactic outflows in a dark matter halo with a   central black hole,astro-ph.ga,"polytropic transonic solutions of spherically symmetric and steady galactic winds in the gravitational potential of a dark matter halo (dmh) with a supermassive black hole (smbh) are studied. the solutions are classified in terms of their topological features, and the gravitational potential of the smbh adds a new branch to the transonic solutions generated by the gravity of the dmh. the topological types of the transonic solutions depend on the mass distribution, the amount of supplied energy, the polytropic index $\gamma$, and the slope $\alpha$ of the dmh mass distribution. when $\alpha$ becomes larger than a critical value $\alpha_\mathrm{c}$, the transonic solution types change dramatically. further, our model predicts that it is possible for a slowly accelerating outflow to exist, even in quiescent galaxies with small $\gamma$. this slowly accelerating outflow differs from those considered in many of the previous studies focusing on supersonic outflows in active star-forming galaxies. in addition, our model indicates that outflows in active star-forming galaxies have only one transonic point in the inner region ($\sim$ 0.01 kpc). the locus of this transonic point does not strongly depend on $\gamma$. we apply the polytropic model incorporating mass flux supplied by stellar components to the sombrero galaxy, and conclude that it can reproduce the observed gas density and the temperature distribution well. this result differs significantly from the isothermal model, which requires an unrealistically large mass flux (igarashi et al. 2014). thus, we conclude that the polytropic model is more realistic than the isothermal model, and that the sombrero galaxy can have a slowly accelerating outflow.",,2015-08-06,2017-06-01,"['asuka igarashi', 'masao mori', 'shin-ya nitta']"
1,1509.03352,towards a new classification of galaxies: principal component analysis   of califa circular velocity curves,astro-ph.ga astro-ph.co,"we present a galaxy classification system for 238 (e1-sdm) califa (calar alto legacy integral field area) galaxies based on the shapes and amplitudes of their circular velocity curves (cvcs). we infer the cvcs from the de-projected surface brightness of the galaxies, after scaling by a constant mass-to-light ratio based on stellar dynamics - solving axisymmetric jeans equations via fitting the second velocity moment $v_{\mathrm{rms}}=\sqrt{v^2+\sigma^2}$ of the stellar kinematics. we use principal component analysis (pca) applied to the cvc shapes to find characteristic features and use a $k$-means classifier to separate circular curves into classes. this objective classification method identifies four different classes, which we name slow-rising (sr), flat (fl), round-peaked (rp) and sharp-peaked (sp) circular curves.   sr are typical for low-mass, late-type (sb-sdm), young, faint, metal-poor and disc-dominated galaxies. sp are typical for high-mass, early-type (e1-e7), old, bright, metal-rich and bulge-dominated galaxies. fl and rp appear presented by galaxies with intermediate mass, age, luminosity, metallicity, bulge-to-disk ratio and morphologies (e4-s0a, sa-sbc). the discrepancy mass factor, $f_d=1-m_{*}/m_{dyn}$, have the largest value for sr and sp classes ($\sim$ 74 per cent and $\sim$ 71 per cent, respectively) in contrast to the fl and rp classes (with $\sim$ 59 per cent and $\sim$ 61 per cent, respectively). circular curve classification presents an alternative to typical morphological classification and appears more tightly linked to galaxy evolution.",10.1093/mnras/stx901,2015-09-10,2017-06-02,"['veselina kalinova', 'dario colombo', 'erik rosolowsky', 'rahul kannan', 'lluís galbany', 'rubén garcía-benito', 'rosa gonzález delgado', 'sebastian f. sánchez', 'tomás ruiz-lara', 'jairo méndez-abreu', 'cristina catalán-torrecilla', 'laura sánchez-menguiano', 'adriana de lorenzo-cáceres', 'luca costantin', 'estrella florido', 'keiichi kodaira', 'raffaella a. marino', 'ronald läsker', 'joss bland-hawthorn']"

137,1706.01469,the sluggs survey: trails of sluggs galaxies in a modified   spin-ellipticity diagram,astro-ph.ga,"we present radial tracks for four early-type galaxies with embedded intermediate-scale discs in a modified spin-ellipticity diagram. here, each galaxy's spin and ellipticity profiles are shown as a radial track, as opposed to a single, flux-weighted aperture-dependent value as is common in the literature. the use of a single ellipticity and spin parameter is inadequate to capture the basic nature of these galaxies, which transition from fast to slow rotation as one moves to larger radii where the disc ceases to dominate. after peaking, the four galaxy's radial tracks feature a downturn in both ellipticity and spin with increasing radius, differentiating them from elliptical galaxies, and from lenticular galaxies whose discs dominate at large radii. these galaxies are examples of so-called discy elliptical galaxies, which are a morphological hybrid between elliptical (e) and lenticular (s0) galaxies, and have been designated es galaxies.   the use of spin-ellipticity tracks provides extra structural information about individual galaxies over a single aperture measure. such tracks provide a key diagnostic for classifying early-type galaxies, particularly in the era of 2d kinematic (and photometric) data beyond one effective radius.",10.1093/mnras/stx1348,2017-06-05,,"['sabine bellstedt', 'alister w. graham', 'duncan a. forbes', 'aaron j. romanowsky', 'jean p. brodie', 'jay strader']"
